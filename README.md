# Casino 
The Casino library is a collection of MCTS methods. MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) is a search algorithm with a wide range of applications, in particular, it has been shown to be far superior to traditional Minimax methods for some board games (e.g. Go).

## Features
Casino has a plugin-based architecture which means that it can be applied to a wide range of problems. Emphasis has been focused on being able to customise which combination of MCTS methods/extensions is applied.
